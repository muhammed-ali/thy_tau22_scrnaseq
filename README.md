# thy_tau22_scRNAseq

## Name
Disentangling sex-specific transcriptomic alterations in the THY-Tau22 mouse model of Alzheimer disease (AD).

## Description
In this project we analyze single cell RNAseq data from mouse cortex to gain insights into AD-associated molecular changes and their sex-dependence for tau-associated pathologies in the cortex as one of the most severely affected brain regions. By studying cell-type specific and cell-type agnostic AD-related changes and their sex-dimorphism for single genes, pathways and cellular sub-networks, we aimed to identify both statistically significant alterations and interpret the upstream mechanisms that control them.

## Project status
We performed the planned computational analysis and drafter the first version of manuscript. At the moment we are actively reviewing and polishing the manuscript draft for submission
